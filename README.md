# shahnil-boutique
[a small, one page website](https://myrahm.github.io/shahnil-boutique/) i created over the summer for a private, family-owned clothing business. dipped my toes in html and css 😄

**includes**:
- a mission statement, featured products and customer review section
- an attractive hover effect button that links to the business' facebook page
- a mobile version of the website, scaled to fit on such mobile devices
