# shahnil-boutique
a small, one page website i created over the summer for a private, family-owned clothing business. dipped my toes in html and css 😄

**includes**:
- a featured products and customer review section
- an attractive hover effect button that links to the bussiness' facebook page
- a mobile version of the website, scaled to fit on such mobile devices
